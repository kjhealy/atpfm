## ATP.fm Shownotes

Kieran Healy
`@kjhealy`

R code to scrape the links in ATP.fm's shownotes and make a few tables and graphs. Also a CSV file of the data, with some variables flagging whether a link is a sponsor or self-link by the hosts.

Data are from Episode 18 to Episode 117, as earlier titles were not easily available from iTunes or the ATP site.
